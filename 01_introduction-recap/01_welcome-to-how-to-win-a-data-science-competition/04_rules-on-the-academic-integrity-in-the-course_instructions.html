  Dear learner!
 </p>
 <p>
  By joining this course, you become part of an academic community where a whole set of values and principles, ethical norms and rules apply. And it is very important to us that when you gain knowledge, you can share the responsibility with us by following the HSE code of honor and Academic Integrity of Coursera.
 </p>
 <p>
  What does this mean?
 </p>
 <p>
  In your written works it is unacceptable to use someone else's texts published in paper or electronic form, without reference to the source.
 </p>
 <p>
  You ought to write by yourself and be sure to refer to those whose fragments you use in your text.
 </p>
 <p>
  * remember that it is not enough to provide a list of "references" at the end of the work
 </p>
 <p>
  • Every time you use someone else's data or retell other people's discoveries and conclusions in your own words, for example, give figures or ideas, you must indicate the source from which you received this data
 </p>
 <p>
  • Please be careful. Even when there are necessary links, the amount of borrowing in your work can not exceed 20%.
 </p>
 <p>
  The online course assistant reviews materials which you submit for review. If the review of your essays reveals a violation of the rules listed above, your work will never be evaluated again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Any other violations of academic integrity will be reviewed by the course's University staff and Coursera support team.
 </p>
 <p>
  The work can be reset by the course staff and then academic supervisors of the relevant educational programs will be informed about violations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Please note that students who fail to comply with the rules may be subject to disciplinary measures:
 </p>
 <p>
  a) remark
 </p>
 <p>
  b) reprimand
 </p>
 <p>
  C) deduction
 </p>
 <p>
  We recommend you to familiarize yourself with the HSE student honor code and Academic Integrity of Coursera before taking the course.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you have any questions about the content of the course or the technical features of the program you are studying, you can leave them on the forum.
 </p>
 <p>
  After completing the course, you can share your comments and suggestions with us. Your feedback will be taken into account in the further development of online courses.
 </p>
 <p>
  Have a nice day!
